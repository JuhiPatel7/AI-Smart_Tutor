# AI Smart Tutor - Environment Configuration
# ============================================
# This file contains all environment variables needed for the AI Smart Tutor application.
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual configuration values.
# NEVER commit .env.local to version control for security reasons.

# ============================================
# Supabase Configuration
# ============================================
# Supabase is used for:
# - User Authentication (login/signup)
# - Database (PostgreSQL) for storing user data, PDFs, annotations
# - Storage buckets for PDF uploads
# 
# Get these from: https://supabase.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → API
# Steps to obtain:
# 1. Create a Supabase account and project
# 2. Go to Project Settings → API
# 3. Copy your project URL and Anon Key

# The public URL of your Supabase project
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# The anonymous key for Supabase - used for client-side authentication
# This key is safe to expose as it has restricted permissions
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here

# Development redirect URL for OAuth callbacks (local development)
# Used during authentication flow for testing locally
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# ============================================
# AI Model Configuration (LLM)
# ============================================
# The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4 mini model for the AI tutor chat functionality
# You can use either:
# - Vercel AI Gateway (when deployed to Vercel) - no API key needed
# - OpenAI API directly (for local development)

# ============================================
# OPTION 1: Vercel AI Gateway (Recommended)
# ============================================
# When your app is deployed to Vercel:
# - AI Gateway automatically authenticates requests
# - No API key configuration needed
# - Superior rate limiting and caching
# 
# For local development with Vercel AI Gateway:
# Get this from: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
# Create a new token with appropriate scopes
# VERCEL_API_KEY=your-vercel-api-key-here

# ============================================
# OPTION 2: OpenAI API (Direct)
# ============================================
# Use this when running locally or if not using Vercel deployment
# 
# Get this from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Steps:
# 1. Log into OpenAI platform
# 2. Go to API keys section
# 3. Create a new secret key
# Note: Your OpenAI account must have a payment method to use the API
# See: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
# 
# This key should start with 'sk-'
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here

# ============================================
# How the AI Configuration Works
# ============================================
# - When DEPLOYED to Vercel: AI Gateway automatically handles authentication
#   and routes requests to OpenAI through Vercel's infrastructure
# - When RUNNING LOCALLY: The code uses OPENAI_API_KEY to authenticate
#   directly with OpenAI API
# - The application uses model identifier "openai/gpt-4o-mini" which works
#   seamlessly with both Vercel AI Gateway and direct OpenAI API
# - The AI tutor uses this LLM to:
#   * Generate educational responses
#   * Provide explanations and clarifications
#   * Answer student questions interactively
#   * Support the chat-based learning interface
